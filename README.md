# GeometryTutor

Repository for a Geometry Tutor Web App using Python and the Django framework.

# Overview

I am a software engineer who wants to create a geometry tutorial website for middle school students.

The web app has tutorial lessons about geometry topics. Each lesson has a quiz to help the student practice what they have learned and measure their success. Students can earn points and rewards as they progress through the lessons.
